# Greetings! üéâ
Hello fellow learners and hackers! Welcome to my 'TryHackMe' repo where I hope you'll find what you came here looking for, which should not be the answers, but a curiosity to learn and practice hacking on TryHackMe Rooms!
# Purpose
This repo mainly contains detailed explanations of rooms that I've solved on TryHackMe, with 2 files per room (most of the times). Out of which, one would be an 'Overview', like a general sense of the room and the other would be 'Practical', which will elaborate the practical tasks of the room and how they are performed.
# Important
Before you move on any further, if you try to download or save any of these files locally on your system, I'd suggest you to use `Obsidian` for keeping notes, for 2 reason
  1. I made these using that, so it's absolutely compatible with it.![ItsAPerfectMatchShaneLuisGIF](https://github.com/scissor-seven/TryHackMe/assets/103362978/3008e01a-7dab-4d46-a7c2-b37a60095230)
  2. It's a great application. With nice features as well, give it a try!![ItsGoodClaireCrosbyGIF](https://github.com/scissor-seven/TryHackMe/assets/103362978/043ca469-f6a4-4bd0-8ae6-97659d838062)

The files I'll upload, I hope you'll be able to understand, if not, I'll most probably put references that you can use such as links or other specific notes.
Sooooooo, that'll be it, hapy hacking! üñ•Ô∏èüöÄ
